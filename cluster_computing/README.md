# Isolation and Resource Management 
Resources are often **shared** among multiple users, applications, or services. The need for isolation arises to ensure that these entities do not interfere with each other, either intentionally or unintentionally, in terms of security, resource utilization, performance, and fault tolerance. 

## List of Questions 
1. What is virtualization? how are they used today?
   - how do you virtualize hardware (cpu, memory, device)?
   - what is the design goal of Xen? and how does it accomplish it? 
2. What is container? how are they used today?
   - how do you implement containerization?
   - should we use centralized or decentralized schedulers to handle containers 
   - what are some problems associated with containers? 
3. What are the trade-offs between virtulization and container?
4. How does exokernel compared to hypervisors?

## Virtualization 
[Virtualization](https://github.com/lynnliu030/os-prelim/blob/main/cluster_computing/virtualization.md) allows multiple guest OSes (and their applications) to share the hardware resources of a single physical server. 

* Virtual resources: each OS thinks that it owns the hardware resources
* Virtual machine: OS + applications + virtual resources
* Virtualization layer: management of physical hardware (e.x. VMM, hypervisor)
    *  emulate the behavior the guest OS expects from the HW  

## Containers 
* Containers are lightweight, encapsulated environments that run applications and their dependencies.
* Unlike virtual machines, containers share the host systemâ€™s kernel, rather than needing their own operating system.
* Mechanisms: kernel featurers like namespace and cgroups 
    *  Namespacing: isolates process trees, networking user IDs, and mounts
    *  Cgroups: limit and prioritize CPU, memory, block I/Os, and network resources
*  Used in microservices
*  Pros: lightweight, fast, and portable 
*  Cons: weaker isolation and security guarantees 

## Virtualization v.s Containers
* VM: virtualize hardware
* Containers: virtualie OS, contains only the application and its libraries and dependencies
* LightVM paper discusses the trade-offs between containers and VMs in terms of performance and security (isolation) guarantees

## Isolation and Fault tolerance 
**Isolation**: keeping different parts of a system separated such that a failure, error, or security breach in one part does not propagate to other parts. This segregation can be in terms of memory, processing, or even network communication.

It is important for fault tolerance because:
* Prevent a single point of failure from bringing down the entire system
* Limit the spread of security vulnerabilities
* Make it easier to identify and fix issues with modules

For example, UNIX provides isolation:
* Process isolation: each process runs in its own address space
* User and group permissions: file and process access control based on user and group permissions
* Namespace: used to isolate different system resources like network, PID, and mounts
   *  i.e. containers  

## Exokernel v.s Hypervisor 
Exokernels and hypervisors have many similarities, in that they multiplex and protect hardware with minimal abstraction. Comparisons are [here](https://github.com/lynnliu030/os-prelim/blob/main/cluster_computing/exokernel_vs_hypervisor.md).
