Reference: http://saurabhjha.github.io/2017/11/11/paper-review-the-structure-of-the-THE-multiprogramming-system.html

”THE” Multiprogramming System was an operating system developed by Dijkstra. The operating system was designed to be a single user while executing concurrent programs. 

Three contributions:
1. A demonstration of the concept of software layering and how it leads to better verification and testing of a system.
2. The idea of software page-based virtual memory.
3. The idea of semaphore for use in concurrency.


_Key Techniques_: Layering of system components, process scheduling, and semaphores for IPC.
