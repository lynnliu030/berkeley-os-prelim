# Dryad: Distributed Data-Parallel Programs from Sequential Building Blocks
Dryad is designed to allow developers to build distributed data-parallel programs using sequential programming constructs. Dryad represents data-parallel computations as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), and the runtime dynamically optimizes execution plans based on available resources and other factors. This approach allows for a flexible and powerful programming model that can be optimized at runtime.
