# Kerberos: An Authentication Service for Open Network Systems (1998) 
Kerberos is an authentication network protocol developed by MIT to provide robust and **secure authentication system in an open network** where **users at workstations** wish to access **services on network servers**. Open networks are susceptible to various kinds of attacks, such as eavesdropping, replay attacks, and impersonation. 

The protocol is based on generating tickets ðŸŽ«.

## Goal
* Security: To protect sensitive data in open networks.
* Transparency: To facilitate straightforward authentication for users without the cumbersome need for repeated logins.

## Key Techniques: Ticket  
There are three components in Kerberos transactions: 
* **KDC (key distribution center)**
  *  Store a copy of all keys (i.e. client keys, service key, and TGS keys) for encryption and decryption purposes
  *  **Authentication server (AS)**: Validates users when they log in
  *  **Ticket granting server (TGS)**: Issues tickets for users to access different services
* **Client**: The user who wants to access a service.
* **Service**: The network resources like files servers or databases that the client wants to access.
 
## Protocol Simple Explain 
1. **Initial Authentication**:
    * Client sends login details to AS
    * AS replies with two messages
       * Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) encrypted with TGS secret key
       * M1: TGS session key encrypted with client's secret key
2. **Request for Service Ticket**:
    * Decrypt M1 with secret key
    * Request access ot a service by taking to TGS
        * Send back TGT
        * Encrypt user authentication with TGS session key
        * M2: <service ID, request lifetime>
    * TGS receives
        * check service is valid
        * decrypt TGT with session key, and decrypt user authentication
    * TGS sends back
        * M3: Service session key encrypted by TGS session key
        * Service ticket (ST): encrypted by TGS secret key
3. **Accessing the service**:
    * User decrypt M3 and get servie session key
    * Use it to encrypt user authentication and send back service ticket
4. **Verification**
    * Service decrypt ST to get session key and decrypt user auth
    * If matches, send back service authenticator encrypted by TGS session key
    * Confirming authentication success and establish secure session

## Pros 
Trust is incrementally built through a series of encrypted ticket exchanges, and authentication is validated at several stages through encrypted, timestamped tickets

## Complete Protocol 
In the Kerberos authentication protocol, a user first authenticates with the authentication server to obtain a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT). When the user needs to access a network service, they use this TGT to request a service-specific ticket from the Ticket Granting Service (TGS), also part of the KDC. This system minimizes the number of times a user needs to enter their password for secure service access. Each step involves encrypted messages and unique session keys to ensure secure communication and prevent unauthorized access.


1. The user sends ticket request <user ID, service ID, TS> access to a service to the authenticator server in KDC.
2. Authenticator server checks the request, create two message to send back
  -  M1
      -  encrypted with client secret key  
      -  <TGS ID, TS, TGS session key>
  -  M2 Ticket Granting Ticket
      -  encrypted with TGS secret key  
      -  <user ID, TGS id, TS, user IP address, lifetime for TGT, TGS session key>
3. The user can now decrypt M1 with their password, get TGS session key, then they send the following messages to TGS
  -  M2: TGT 
  -  M3: <service ID, request lifetime>
  -  M4: User Authenticator <user ID, TS> 
      -  Encrypted by TGS session key
4. TGS receive
  -  verify service ID, if found, grab service secret key
  -  decrypt TGT with TGS secret key, get TGS session key
  -  use TGS session key to decrypt M4
  -  now get TGT and M4, check user ID, TS, and IP addr, also check if M4 in cache or not (replay protection) 
5. TGS send to user 
  -  M5: <service ID, TS, lifetime, Service Session Key>
    -  encrypted by TGS session key
  -  M6: Service Ticket
      -  <user ID, service ID, TS, Service Session Key>
      -  encrypted by Service Secret Key 
6. User
  -  decrypt M5 with TGS session key and get service session key 
  -  send to service
      -  M6: Service Ticket 
      -  M7: User Authenticator <user ID> encrypted with service session key
7. Service
  - Decrypt M6 with service secret key, get service session key
  - Decrypt M7
  - Do similar checking on cache and match
  - Then send back M8: Service Authenticator <Service ID, TS> encrypted by service session key
  - Users can now decrypt with the same symmetric key, verify the service name matches as expected, look at the cache, etc.

## Basics 
1. Mutual Trust via Third Party: The AS and TGS act as trusted third parties. The mutual trust between a user and a service is established indirectly via trust in these servers.

2. Scalability: Because users don't interact directly with service servers for authentication (but go through TGS instead), the system is more scalable. Each service doesnâ€™t need to implement its authentication logic; it just needs to be able to decrypt a message from the TGS.
